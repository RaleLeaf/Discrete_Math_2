    "To find the probability of observing at least one defective fuse in a sample of 5 from a lot of 5000 electrical fuses containing 5% defectives, we can use the concept of binomial probability.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Number of trials, $n = 5$ (sampling 5 fuses)\n",
    "- Probability of success (defective fuse), $p = 0.05$\n",
    "- Probability of failure (non-defective fuse), $q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$\n",

    "Let $Y$ represent the number of defective fuses observed during the 5 trials.\n",

    "$ P(Y \\geq 1) = 1 - P(Y = 0) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3:\n",
    "To find $P(Y = 0)$ (the probability of observing no defective fuses), we use the binomial probability formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(Y = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\times p^k \\times q^{n-k} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4:\n",
    "Where $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of combinations of choosing $k$ successes out of $n$ trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5:\n",
    "In this case, $k = 0$ (no defective fuses), $n = 5$, $p = 0.05$, and $q = 0.95$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6:\n",
    "Let's calculate $P(Y \\geq 1)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(Y \\geq 1) = 1 - P(Y = 0) $\n",

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:\n",
    "To find the expected value of the given probability distribution, which is a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$, denoted as $E(Y)$, we can use the definition of the expected value for discrete random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ E(Y) = \\sum_{y=0}^{\\infty} y \\cdot p(y) $\n",

    "$ E(Y) = \\sum_{y=0}^{\\infty} y \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^y}{y!} e^{-\\lambda} $\n",

    "Now, let's make a substitution to simplify the expression inside the sum. Let $k = y - 1$, then $y = k + 1$. Also, note that when $y = 1$, $k = 0$, and when $y$ approaches infinity, $k$ also approaches infinity. With these substitutions, the sum becomes:\n",
